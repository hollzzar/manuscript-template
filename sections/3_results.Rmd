Here we report the mean values and standard deviations of the weight variable (*M* = `r test_mean` lbs, *SD* = `r test_sd` lbs).

```{r test-graph, fig.cap = "Example of a figure caption."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/test_graph.png")
```

Like tables, you can reference figure numbers using the alphanumeric chunk label, as in Figure \@ref(fig:test-graph). Unlike tables, the figure caption goes in the chunk arguments using `fig.cap`, rather than in the `kable` function itself.

Using the helper functions in the `source_script.R` file, I can easily include APA-formatted statistics for the correlation between miles per gallon and weight (`r mt_apa`).
